## Description
Words Guessing Game is a simple Python application that selects a random word from a list of words and prompts the user to guess letters. The program checks whether the guessed letter is in the word and provides feedback accordingly. The aim of this project is to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and user input validation.

**What it does:**
- Randomly selects a word from a list.
- Prompts the user to guess a letter.
- Validates the user's input.
- Checks if the guessed letter is in the selected word and provides feedback.

**What you will learn:**
- How to use loops and conditionals.
- How to define and call functions.
- How to handle user input and validate it.
- Basic principles of code organization and modularity.
